# MSD Front-End Excercise

## Description

Your task is to create a simple page containing list of published posts from a predefined API https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/12176839/Tz5s5xJW
 
On the page there should be a header with simple a menu with categories and search input. Header should scroll with the page and sticked on top. It should be possible to filter posts by a category.

It could look like this, but feel free to do it differently:

```
|--------------------------------------------------------------|
|                          _________             ____________  |
|  POSTS         Filter:  | Space > |   Search: |            | |
|                          ---------             ------------  |
|--------------------------------------------------------------|
```


Show list of posts. For each post show title, excerpt, author, category and tags.
 
As a bonus you can show  also the two images available: author's avatar and post thumbnail.

```
|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| |---|  Title | @Author    |  Excerpt                         |
| | x |                     |  ....................            |
| |___|  Category | Tags    |  ....................            |
|--------------------------------------------------------------|

|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| |---|  Title | @Author    |  Excerpt                         |
| | x |                     |  ....................            |
| |___|  Category | Tags    |  ....................            |
|--------------------------------------------------------------|

|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| |---|  Title | @Author    |  Excerpt                         |
| | x |                     |  ....................            |
| |___|  Category | Tags    |  ....................            |
|--------------------------------------------------------------|
```

## Goals
 
We work mostly in ReactJS but feel free to use vanilla JS or any other library you are comfortable working in. Our goal of this excercise is to understand the level of your skills and coding experience, so priorities for us are:

1) Clean code
2) Basic concepts & good practices
3) Tests (at least some; you can also just descrie your testing strategy if you are short on time)

In general, use any tools and libraries you are familiar with. Again, React is a plus but anything is good. **Also, if you don't manage to finish some part because of lack of time, try to explain your intent in a comment.**
 

## How to do it

1) Fork this repo
2) Implement the feature
3) Submit a PR
4) Let us know :)
